            Derry City football club has been rocked by the sudden death of its captain Ryan McBride, who was just 27 years old.
            The cause of death is currently unknown but McBride was found dead in his bedroom on Sunday afternoon.
            A large crowd of the club's fans gathered outside the defender's house, which is close to Derry's Brandywell Stadium.
            The news comes as a huge blow to both the club and local community. 
            McBride appeared in good health just 24 hours earlier as he helped his side beat Drogheda United 4-0 in their League of Ireland clash.

            Derry City posted a tribute to their late captain online, a tweet that read: "Captain fantastic."
            Clubs around Ireland also tweeted their support.
            A statement from Glentoran read: "Deepest heartfelt condolences from all at Glentoran to Ryan's family and to our many friends at Derry City."
            Dundalk added: "All at Dundalk send our deepest sympathy to the family and friends of Ryan McBride and our friends at Derry City. Shocking and sad news."

            Cork City, meanwhile, tweeted: Our deepest sympathies to all at Derry City on the sudden passing of Ryan McBride. Our thoughts are with his family and friends. RIP."
            This is just the latest tragedy to hit Derry City, who lost club legend Mark Farren to a brain tumour in February last year. He was just 33 years old.
            Derry were due to face Limerick on Tuesday night but that fixture is now in doubt.
