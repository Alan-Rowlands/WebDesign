        <h1>David Haye vs Tony Bellew result: Upset at the O2 after stunning fight</h1>
        
        <p>
            Tony Bellew caused a huge upset by stepping up two weights and stopping an incapacitated David Haye in the 11th round in a gripping, all-British heavyweight grudge fight at the O2 Arena on Saturday.
            Haye, on his third fight in his boxing comeback, appeared to injure his right Achilles in the sixth round but fought on courageously despite virtually being a sitting target.
            It emerged on Sunday that Bellew had also suffered a bad injury during the fight - breaking his hand as early as the second round. However, it didn't prevent him from dominating the battle.

            Bellew, the WBC cruiserweight champion, showed patience in picking his moment to finish off Haye and the end came in the close stages of the 11th with a flurry of punches that sent his rival out of the ring. 
            Haye climbed back into the ring, but his corner threw in the towel.The 36-year-old Haye's career looks in jeopardy after a third loss in his career. Bellew was giving up 11 pounds and fighting his first professional bout at heavyweight.

        <h3>What they said</h3>
        
        <h4>David Haye:</h4>
        
        <p>
            "It is what it is, we get injuries in this game. Sometimes you work round them but unfortunately it was my right leg, if it had been my left I might have had more of a chance.
            I dished out my best effort, it wasn't good enough and I was beaten fair and square. The better man won. All credit to him. I always knew he was tough, I always knew he had a big heart and I congratulate him. 
            He did what he needed to do and I would love the opportunity to do it again. The ball is in his court."
        </p>
        
        <h4>Tony Bellew:</h4>
        <p>
            "I've achieved what I got in boxing for tonight. I just made my three kids wealthy. If it was about me I could have quit after Goodison. I made my three kids wealthy.
            Just before the stoppage I looked at David and said 'stop now'. He shook his head. He went beyond the call of duty.
            No-one has ever been able to stop David on his feet. I'm honoured because in my eyes I beat the best cruiserweight this country has ever produced and one of the best heavyweights.
            He made the same mistake everybody else does. He underestimated me. I can't believe what I've done. Me and Eddie (Hearn, my promoter) resurrected my career; I was finished when I came to Eddie. I'm so indebted to him and his dad (Barry)."
